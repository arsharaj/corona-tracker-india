# Corona Tracker India
> Stay Home ,
> Be Safe !

**Motive**

As a developer, I also want to do something during this huge pandemic situation, so I develop a python script to automatically trace out the required data for faster analysis and work out with it. This is a small thanks from my side to all those who are working out onto the field and fighting with Covid19.

----------

**Features**
1. Cross-platform python script
2. Statewise information
3. Log the data into a txt file

----------

**Prerequisites**
1. python3 should be installed onto the system.
2. pip3 should be installed onto the system.
3. pip3 and python3 should be inside the environment variables (only for windows users)

----------

**Installation**

> `pip3 install corona-tracker-india`

or

> `pip install corona-tracker-india`

----------

**Usage**

- Create a new python file and write these lines into it.
- Create this file in the directory where you want to store the data.

- Importing the package :

> `from corona_tracker_india.tracker import track_corona_india`

- Using the functionality :

> `track_corona_india()`

- Now simply execute the script with this command:

> `python3 name_of_the_file.py`

1. If there is no error then everthing is perfect.
2. Check for the corona-data folder in the same repository.
3. Inside this folder the today's latest data will be fetched automatically as soon as you run the script.
